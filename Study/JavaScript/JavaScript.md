## Table of Contents

1. **[Variables & Data Types](Concept/Variables.md)**  
   Learn about different data types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, objects, and arrays) and how variables are declared and used.

2. **[Functions & Scope](Concept/Functions.md)**  
   Explore how functions work, including scope and execution context.  
   - **[Function Declarations and Expressions](Concept/FunctionsAndForms.md)**
   - **[Closures Documentation](Concept/closure.md)**  
     Understand how inner functions capture the outer function's variables and how closures enable data privacy and state maintenance.
   - **[Higher Order Function](Concept/higher_order_functions.md)**


3. **[Objects & Arrays](Concept/ObjectsArrays.md)**  
   Study JavaScript objects, arrays, and methods for manipulating these data structures.

4. **[Control Structures & Loops](Concept/ControlLoops.md)**  
   Cover conditionals (if/else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while) to control program flow.

5. **[Hoisting](Concept/Hoisting.md)**  
   Discover how JavaScript's hoisting mechanism affects variable and function declarations.

6. **[ES6 & Beyond](Concept/ES6.md)**  
   Familiarize yourself with the enhancements introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and later versions, including arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and more.

7. **[Asynchronous JavaScript](Concept/Asynchronous.md)**  
   Learn about asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await.  
   - **[Promises](Concept/Promises.md)**
   - **[Async/Await](Concept/AsyncAwait.md)**

8. **[Modules & Classes](Concept/ModulesClasses.md)**  
   Understand the modularity in JavaScript through modules (import/export) and the class-based syntax for object-oriented programming.

9. **[DOM Manipulation](Concept/DOM.md)**  
   Dive into interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically modify web pages.

10. **[Error Handling](Concept/ErrorHandling.md)**  
    Learn how to handle errors gracefully using try/catch, throw, and finally. And more.

11. **[Event Loop & Concurrency](Concept/EventLoop.md)**  
    Explore how JavaScript manages asynchronous tasks using the event loop, microtasks, and macrotasks.

12. **[Fetch API & AJAX](Concept/Fetch.md)**  
    Review methods for communicating with external servers via AJAX and the Fetch API.

## Related Technologies

- **[React Overview](Concept/React/react.md)**  
  React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses components, state, and hooks to create dynamic and efficient web applications.

- **[Node.js Overview](Concept/Nodejs/node.md)**  
  Node.js is a runtime environment that executes JavaScript on the server side. It is ideal for building scalable network applications and microservices.
